# Stock Market Simulator

This project allows users to access real-time prices to simulate the trading of stocks within a portfolio.

## Overview

Users have the ability to create accounts, each of which start out with $10,000 in cash. Then, users have the option to look up stock prices, buy and sell stocks, and view a history of their previous transactions in order to build their portfolio. Users also have the ability to add in additional cash manually in order to increase their portfolio value.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run line 13 of application.py (without the #) in the terminal in order to access the API used to get stock prices. Then, run the following in the terminal
```flask run```
and follow the instructions given by the Flask app to continue running the site.
